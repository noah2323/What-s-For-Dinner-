# What-s-For-Dinner-
"What's for Dinner?" was a basic project I created using kivy in python. It goes over the basics of app development. Too many times my roommates and I can never choose where to go for dinner. This app allows us to input all the restaurants that come to our mind and then the software will randomly choose a restaurant for us. I am certain many other families have this problem when thinking about dinner. That is why I decided to attempt this basic app so that people can truly know what's going to be for dinner. There is a main python code file as well as a .kv file for the formatting. I will be using a different software to make the app "prettier" but for now the formatting I have gets the job done.
